; The isometric tileset used with this demo has been designed by NullDreams
; please visit his page to see his more of his work here: https://nulldreams.itch.io

; This program exemplifies how you can load different 8 bit palette based PNG files with different color palettes and merge those into one of the
; video palettes that's meant to draw them. The usecase for such a situation is when you have some fixed tileset you need to render on the same
; layer as other tiles that can change depending on the level. As such, to not overflow the palette capacity you would slice the tiles on themes
; pertaining to each individual level and merge them using this mechanism each time you move to a different game level.
